# VQ_VAE_Naver
This project is the implementation for VQ VAE that is combined Vector quantistaions with Variational encoder. In
this project I used Pytorch for implementing the model.

### Prerequisites

python 3
pytorch
jupyter notebook

## Getting start
 the file 'VQ_VAE_model.md' is the model of VQ_VAE

 the file'Main.md' includes the traning set , testing set and also loss function

### training and testing

the training set and testing set have been showed in the main.md file which include the result of samples
